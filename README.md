# Screeps Source

Screeps is an MMO programming RTS [game](https://screeps.com/). These are my src files which will probably be broken and inefficient.
I recommend using someone elses code.

This repo is based on [Screeps-Typescript-Starter](https://github.com/screepers/screeps-typescript-starter).

## Setup

The main thing is to rename **screeps-example.json** to **screeps.json** and edit it with correct settings.
Note that the password is required and needs to be setup using the [screeps-auth-mod](https://github.com/ScreepsMods/screepsmod-auth).

Make sure to run `npm install` to installed the required node packages.

I only cared about the private server settings so if you want to push to official servers, take a look at the original template mentioned above.
